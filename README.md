## About

Want to chat about code, beer, coffee, pizza, books, design, journalism, etc?

ok. üëç.

This is similar to ["ask me anything" repos](https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas) other folks have created.

Except don't ask me _anything_. Just a few minimal guidelines:

### Don't ask

Bug reports and other project-specific topics should go to the relevant issue queues or discussion forums.

Interested in paying me to work on a project or are we already working together? Please only send email (sethvincent@gmail.com) or use other project-specific forums for chatting about those projects.

Weird personal things.

### Do ask

Reasonable personal things. Maybe slightly weird is ok? idk I guess we'll find out.

About open source, journalism, food, beer, coffee, travel, etc.

General code, writing, design questions. (Bugs and other project specific issues should go to the relevant issue queues)

### Other guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered. [Read existing questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc).
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Be civil and polite. Not sure what that might include? Read the [code of conduct](CONDUCT.md).
